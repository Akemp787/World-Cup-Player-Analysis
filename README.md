## Age According to Starters vs Substitutes:
## Background for Comparison:
According to a study done by The Athletic in 2021, the peak age for a soccer player is 26.29 years old. 
- Source: Worville, T. (2021, November 15). What Age Do Players in Different Positions Peak? The Athletic. https://theathletic.com/2935360/2021/11/15/what-age-do-players-in-different-positions-peak/)

## Data Analysis:

Range of ages for starters in the World Cup: 25.64-30.62 years old

Mean Age of a Starting Player- 28.40

- Although The Athletic determined that the peak age for a soccer player was 26.29 years old, the average starting player in the 2022 World Cup was 2.11 years older than that. This suggests a greater emphasis on experience and veteran presence over youthful athleticism. 

### Teams with the highest ages per starting squad:

Belgium (30.62)

Uruguay (30.00) 

Qatar (29.79) 

IR Iran (29.69)

Mexico (29.67)

**Possible Explanations:** 

- The above teams may value experience over youth amongst their starting players.
- There may be a player or two that are significantly older that skew the average towards the higher end of ages for starting players. 

### Teams with the lowest ages per starting squad:

England (27.53)

Ghana (27.14) 

Spain (26.88)

Ecuador (26.43) 

United States (25.64)

_Possible Explanations:_

- Much like above, the ages for these starting lineups may be skewed by a player that is significantly younger than the rest. 
- In the US, there is much more competition from other sports that draw the countryâ€™s top athletes, meaning that fewer of them choose to pursue professional soccer. 

### Average Age of Substitute Players Per Country:**

Range: 24.14-29.50 years old

Mean Age of Substitute Player: 27.45 years old

### Teams with Highest Age per Substitute Player:
Qatar (29.50)

Tunisia (29.33) 

Canada (29.09) 

IR Iran (29.00)

Uruguay (28.90) 

**Possible Explanations:**

IR Iran, Uruguay, and Qatar were all also in the top five oldest starters list, suggesting that they have an older group of players from which to field a team. 

### Teams with Lowest Age per Substitute Player:
United States (26.22)

Senegal (25.64)

Costa Rica (25.50) 

France (25.43)

Ecuador (24.14)

**Possible Explanations:**

- Many teams use major international competitions as a development path for their young players, with the hope that younger, more energetic players are able to surprise their older rivals. 
- Coaches may prefer to have younger players on their bench since they are less likely to deal with major injuries. 

## Question 3: How does the age of players impact the final standings of teams in the World Cup, and what patterns or trends emerge when comparing the top four teams to the bottom four teams?

### Effect of Age on Final World Cup Standings:
**Top Four Teams:**

**General Observations and Implications:**

- All final four teams had an average starting age under 29 years old; avg starting age was 28.18
- No teams with an average starting age of 29 or higher advanced past the Round of 16
- These things indicate that the most successful teams need to have a blend of experience while maintaining enough youth to be in peak athletic condition
- The average starting age of the bottom four teams (28.55) was only .37 years (4mo. 13 days) higher than the top four teams. 
- Two of the bottom four teams had an average starting age over 29

## Question 4: What is the distribution of goals scored based on the age groups of players, and how does this information relate to playing time and peak performance?

### Goals Scored according to ages:
The oldest player to score  at the World Cup was born in 1983, with the youngest being born in 2004. That encompasses a 21 year age difference.

![Screenshot (19)](https://github.com/Akemp787/Project-1/assets/146573396/71b7e012-e4ce-4531-952e-15c58f5c7564)


_The above table adequately summarizes the goals scored in the tournament._

- The oldest and youngest age groups both had the least number of goalscorers. This would be as a result of these age groups being given the least amount of playing time. 
- Another explanation behind this is the oldest age group would primarily consist of players who would not be relied upon for their goal scoring.
- Majority of the goals came from the 1996-1998 age group, boosted by the player who had the most goals in the tournament being born in 1998 (8 goals). 
- The second most goals were scored by a player in the 1987-1989 age group (7 goals).
- With a majority of the age goals coming in the age groups starting from 1990 to 2001, this would indicate that these are the players who were given the most playing time and/or were in the peak of their careers.
- 563 players didnâ€™t score a goal

- As shown above the more goals scored the fewer the number of players. An indication of how hard it is to score more goals.

### Goals, Assists, and Starters: 
- Teams that scored and assisted more tended to advance farther into the tournament 
- Only one team had the most amount of starters per game and won the tournament, 
Argentina

 Changing their team but keeping the base of Messi up front, De Paul in midfield and Martinez in goal allowed Argentina to experiment against teams with different defensive structures

- A goal can be given without an assist if the goal is scored via the following: 

Penalty kick 

Direct free kick 

Own goal 


## Question 5: How do age demographics relate to disciplinary aspects in the World Cup, such as yellow and red card incidents, and what insights can be derived from analyzing the average age of carded players by country?

### Yellow/Red card age analysis
#### Yellow Carded Players/Age by country

**Most Yellow Carded Players by Country**

Saudi Arabia - 12 (Avg Age: 28.7)

Netherlands - 11 (Avg Age: 27.5)

Argentina - 10 (Avg Age:     28.4) 

**Fewest Yellow Carded Players by Country**

England - 1 (Avg Age: 27.7)

Spain - 2 (Avg Age: 27.0)       

Ecuador - 2 (Avg Age: 25.7)

**Average Playerâ€™s Age per yellow card count**

Zero yellow cards

- 453 players (Avg Age: 27.9)

Minimum 1 yellow card

- 195 players (Avg Age: 28.6)

Minimum 2 yellow cards

- 29 players (Avg Age: 28.4)

Three yellow cards

- 2 players (Avg Age: 29.0)

_Both Argentine players (World Cup Winners and played in the most amount of games)_

**Prossible Explanations:**

- Countries that played more games were more likely to have more carded players due to more playing time compared to countries that played fewer games were more likely to have fewer carded players

- Future analysis of games played to average age of yellow cards received 
Observation of slightly higher age in countries with more yellow carded players and slightly higher age of carded players to non-carded players.

- Future analysis could look at player position to average age and yellows card received 
Future analysis to compare number of fouls committed by playerâ€™s age to number of yellow cards

**Red Card Age Analysis**

Average Playerâ€™s Age per red card count:

- 676 players didnâ€™t receive a red card

        Average age 28.1

- 4 players received one red card
    
        Average age 29.8
        Small data sample
        ***Wales goalkeeper (age 35) received the only direct red card in the World Cup

**Probable Explanations:**

- Small sample size of only four red carded players average age to 676 non-red carded players age.  
- Observation of slightly older average age or red carded players to non red carded players


## Potential limitations: 
While our dataset provides valuable insights into World Cup 2022 player age dynamics, it's crucial to acknowledge potential limitations. Firstly, the dataset's accuracy hinges on the reliability of the sources, and any inaccuracies or omissions in player records could impact our findings. Additionally, the dataset may lack certain contextual factors influencing player age, such as injuries, career transitions, or late additions to teams. The analysis assumes that age is the sole determinant of player performance, overlooking other crucial factors like skill level, fitness, and playing experience. Moreover, variations in team selection criteria and playing strategies among nations may introduce biases. Lastly, the dataset's static nature limits our ability to capture real-time changes in player demographics or team dynamics. Recognizing these limitations enhances the interpretative scope of our analysis and encourages a nuanced understanding of the presented findings.

## Conclusion: 

In conclusion, the analysis of the 2022 Qatar World Cup player statistics has yielded valuable insights into team composition, age dynamics, and performance outcomes. Key findings include a consistent squad size across teams and a balanced age distribution, with variations in team strategies evident through age disparities. The preference for experience over youthful athleticism, particularly in starting lineups, impacted the success of teams, as none with an average starting age of 29 or higher advanced past the Round of 16. Goal-scoring patterns highlighted the contribution of players in their peak years, while disciplinary aspects revealed older players receiving more yellow cards on average. Acknowledging potential limitations, such as the static nature of the dataset, these findings contribute to a nuanced understanding of the interplay between age, team dynamics, and performance in the World Cup. Looking ahead, future analyses could explore individual player roles, tactical strategies, and the impact of key moments. Incorporating advanced analytics and machine learning models could offer predictive insights, while extending the dataset to cover multiple World Cup editions would reveal longitudinal trends. Additionally, considering external factors like technology, coaching changes, and player demographics could provide valuable context, further enhancing our holistic understanding of football dynamics.
